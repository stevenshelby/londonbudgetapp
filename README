There is an admin element for this site that lets you see the feedback generated from the adds and cuts page.

go to [URL]/feedbacks/ and you will be asked to log in

email: admin@london.ca
password: LondonRules

You will now be in administration mode.  A log out link will show at the top of the page while logged in.

Data on any page can be modified if not correct.  I wrote what was said at the information session
but if it is deemed incorrect, I can change it in a flash.

The test feedback data can be cleared out when / if this site goes live to the public. It was put in to show
the feedback summary page.

Any questions, please email stevenshelby@gmail.com

Thanks for your consideration.
