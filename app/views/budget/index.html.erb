  <b>What is the difference between an Operating Budget and a Tax Supported by Service Budget?</b>
  <p>
  The difference is fairly simple. An operating budget deals with operations within the city. 
  The operating budget is funded by approximately 65% from taxes, and the remaining by
  grants and user fees.
  </p>

  <p>
  The tax supported by service budget is also
  called a capital budget and deals with issues that need funding over a period of time. Road repaving, protective services, and transportation 
  services are examples of capital expenditures.
